# etudes
JITted PTA analysis code for use with modern MC samplers such as NUTS. At one point I thought had some clever acronym set up for the name, something like **E**nhanced PTA analyses **T**hro**U**gh **D**erivative-based **S**ampling methods. It was too clunky... and the "U" felt shoehorned in. You can call it that if you want. I probably won't.

## Installation
Currently the best way to install etudes is through a pip installation of this git repository. Something like the following should do the trick.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/gabefreedman/etudes.git
```

## General Use
See examples folder for tips on setting up a continuous gravitational wave source with a common red-noise process included in the model. The example sets up the model and sampler. From there it can be extrapolated to more complicated (or simpler) modeling choices. Other example scripts will be added in the future.

## To-do Development
- Add and test pulsar term inclusion in CW delay functions.
- Options for varied EFAC, EQUAD, GP_ECORR for models with `backend_select=True`.
- More example notebooks/scripts.

## Favorite etudes?
I'm only really familiar with the broader repertoire for piano. The Scriabin Etude in D-sharp minor Op.8 No. 12 is an all-time favorite. The Chopin Etude in E-Major Op. 10 No. 3 is also up there. How about you?
